# Signal Processing: EEG filtering and visualization

The brain’s electrical activity can be recorded with electrodes placed on the scalp to produce an electroencephalograph (EEG).
EEGs are most often used to provide information about brain abnormalities or in the domain of brain computer interfaces- where
software and/or hardware applications are controlled solely with a user’s brain activity. The data collected from an EEG recording
is very noisy due to the complexity of the underlying brain activity but can be filtered and transformed to extract features of
interest. There are many methods by which to “clean” EEG data and this paper demonstrates the signal processing techniques and
exploratory data analyses I did on a selected raw EEG data set.

The EEG_Signal_Processing.m file is a matlab script which I created to perform the analyses and visualizations outlined in the Methods,Results.pdf.
